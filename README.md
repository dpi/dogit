_[Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/) + Git CLI application._

[doGit](https://dogit.dev) assists in making the transition to merge requests, and general Git operations, easier for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) developers. 

doGit is typically required globally with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```shell
composer global require dpi/dogit 
```

Various commands are included:

 - [**Convert** a Drupal.org issue with existing patches to a Git branch][wiki-PatchToBranch], ready to be pushed as a new merge request, as `dogit git ISSUE-ID`.
 - [Interactively **clone** or **checkout** a merge request of a project][wiki-ProjectMergeRequest], as `dogit project:mr PROJECT`.
